# Dynamic Quote Generator  
By : Soeng senghorng 

## 📖 Project Overview  
The Dynamic Quote Generator is a small web application that shows a **random quote** whenever you click a button.  
This project was made to practice connecting:  
- **Frontend** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)  
- **Backend** (Node.js + Express)  
- **Database** (quotes.json file) instead of SQLlite and it more convinient since im not familar with Backend. 

It is a simple example of how websites and servers work together.
